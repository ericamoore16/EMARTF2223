	<div id="box3"><h2>It is difficult to determine if the Northeastern art 
would be considered “Banksy”. However, I believe 
that in meaning and heart, this piece would be
considered Banksy. Banksy works are meant to 
bring joy to the viewer in places of normalcy, such
as a slab of concrete. This image of a small boy 
brings the unexpected to a mundane area of 
campus.
