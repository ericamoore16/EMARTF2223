    <p>History and Importance of Tea on International Tea Day</p>
  </div>

  <div id="txt">
    <p>Tea has been around for centuries, and no one knows for sure where it originated. However, there are many myths and legends as to where the beverage got its start. The earliest known mention of tea comes from China, when a leaf fell into Emperor Shen Nung's hot water, enhancing the taste. Portugese merchants, later bringing tea back from Asia, introduced it to Europe. A common pastime of afternoon tea was invented by the Duchess of Bedford, who enjoyed a snack midday. Finally, the well-known tea bag was accidentally formed when a tea vendor sold the leaves in a silk bag, mistakenly put into the water. These many tales form the history of tea.</p>
    <p>In addition to the incredible origins of tea, there is also great cultural and societal signifigance. For example, in India, the leaves of a tea plant were fabeled to give strength to stay awake to Prince Dharma, practicing Bhuddism on a nine-year mission with no sleep. Tea's health benefits have been researched, including its antioxidant effects of cancer and cardiovascular diseases. In fact, there is even an International Tea Day, celebrated by this Google Doodle, to honor this drink, and its history and signifigance.</p>
